    :keyword str correlation_header: the name of the header to use
        for correlation.  If this keyword is omitted, then the header
        is named ``Correlation-ID``.

    This mix-in ensures that responses include a header that correlates
    requests and responses.  If there header is set on the incoming
    request, then it will be copied to the outgoing response.  Otherwise,
    a new UUIDv4 will be generated and inserted.  The value can be
    examined or modified via the ``correlation_id`` property.

    The MRO needs to contain something that resembles a standard
    :class:`tornado.web.RequestHandler`.  Specifically, we need the
    following things to be available:

    - :meth:`~tornado.web.RequestHandler.prepare` needs to be called
      appropriately
    - :meth:`~tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_header` needs to exist in
      the MRO and it needs to overwrite the header value
    - :meth:`~tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_default_headers` should be
      called to establish the default header values
    - ``self.request`` is a object that has a ``headers`` property that
      contains the request headers as a ``dict``.
